## Goals for the future:
- Make the algorithm be able to predict more accurately (within 10 dollars or more)
    - Increased epochs, batch sizes, until I max their utility out
    - Understand how to implement News into this (extremely hard)
    - Just make this more accurate by doing things that actual traders do
- Be able to predict more than 1 day into the future 
    - Make these future day predictions as accurate as possible (extremely hard/impossible?)
- Attempt to do pairs trading with statistical arbitrage
    - Use the other market making strategies (liquidity provision, delta neutral, scalping)
- Add more stocks, and have the bot pick out the stock to increase in by observing the greatest increase in future
